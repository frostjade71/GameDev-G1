# VocabWorld Assets

This folder should contain the following image files for the VocabWorld game header:

## Required Images:

1. **vocabworldhead.png** - The VocabWorld logo/header image
   - Should be a PNG image with transparent background
   - Recommended size: 200x40 pixels or similar aspect ratio
   - Will be displayed on the left side of the header
   - No border will be applied since it's a PNG

2. **vocabworldbackgound.webp** - The header background image
   - Should be a WebP image for optimal performance
   - Recommended size: 1920x60 pixels or similar aspect ratio
   - Will be used as the background for the entire header
   - Should complement the royal blue theme

## Image Guidelines:

- **vocabworldhead.png**: Should contain the VocabWorld branding/logo
- **vocabworldbackgound.webp**: Should be a subtle background that doesn't interfere with text readability
- Both images should maintain the royal blue color scheme
- Images should be optimized for web use (compressed but high quality)

## Current Status:
- Placeholder files are referenced in the code
- Replace with actual images when available
- The header will work with any appropriately sized images

## File Structure:
```
